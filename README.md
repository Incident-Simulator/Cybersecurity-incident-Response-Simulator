# Cybersecurity-Incident-Response-Simulator
This hands-on simulation is designed to enhance the understanding of how to respond to real-world cybersecurity incidents, providing practical experience in identifying and mitigating attacks while documenting the process effectively.

The project involves building a virtual infrastructure using tools like VirtualBox or VMware, simulating attacks using tools like Metasploit and Nmap, and detecting/responding to these attacks using tools like Wireshark, Splunk. It concludes with generating reports and presenting findings to stakeholders.
